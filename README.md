# The-Impact-of-Indian-Serials-in-Our-Society-Perspective-of-different-age-Groups
It was an assignment research project of my Bachelor course Research Methodology on a social problem of that time(2015). One of the important parts of it is data analysis and the analysis was done by MS Excel.
The analysis was done exclusively on primary data which was collected by questionnaire survey.
The main objective was to find the detail impacts of Indian serials in the Society.
